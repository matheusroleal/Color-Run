# Color-Run
Video Game for kids, using LÖVE and Lua

## Gameplay
As the target audience is aimed at children, we created a more
simple game, but with ideas that would provide some learning. For this, it was
established an idea involving the colors, primary and secondary, and the
speed of the camera to make the game more challenging. You have to hit the sequence
of colors on the platforms to get across the five different worlds as fast as possible.
Each time that the user advances a phase, the game camera becomes faster and the sequence
color becomes more challenging. For example: to reach the green color the user must press
simultaneously the blue and yellow color.
